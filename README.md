# FLAN-T5-Summarization-Task
**Prompt Engineering**

## Notebook Overview 
This notebook consists of two primary sections:

1. **Summarize Dialogue Without Prompt Engineering**
   In this section, we employ the LLM (FLAN-T5-Base) model to generate summaries without relying on specific prompt texts.

2. **Summarize Dialogue With Instructional Prompts**
   Within this section, we delve into multiple phases:
   - Zero-Shot Inference
   - One-Shot Inference
   - Few-Shot Inference

   To provide precision, we explore various prompt sentence structures, with two distinct methods showcased in the notebook.

Throughout the notebook, we emphasize the augmentation of inferences and examples fed into the model to enhance overall accuracy.
